Fay Logging EntLib5
===========

What is it?
-----------

It is a Fay Logging facade for the Microsoft Enterprise Library Logging Application Block version 5. This facade povides a simple delegate logging API making logging easier, while helping to make sure any of the code required to generate a log message is not executed unless the logging level is within scope.
